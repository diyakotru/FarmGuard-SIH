# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## About this project

This workspace contains a simple landing page for "FarmGuard", a prototype front-end for a biosecurity management platform for pig and poultry farms. The landing page highlights features like Risk Assessment Tools, Interactive Training, Compliance Tracking, Real-Time Alerts, multilingual and mobile-friendly design.

## Running locally

This project uses Vite + React. To run the development server:

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) to see the landing page.

Feel free to adapt the components and styles in `src/App.jsx` and `src/App.css` to turn this into a full app.
